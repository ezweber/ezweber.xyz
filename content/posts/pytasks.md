Pytasks is my solution to coming up with good ideas for projects and then promptly forgeting them 30 minutes later. It's also useful for remembering chores and other items. It reads and writes from a file in your home directory. You can add items with the -a or --add options, you can delete items with the -d and --delete options, and you can list your todo list with -l and --list. I find it useful to put it in my .bashrc file so everytime I open the terminal I can see what I need to do.

You can find this project on [Github](https://github.com/ezweber/pytasks)
