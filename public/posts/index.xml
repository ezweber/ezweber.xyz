      <description>Installing vShpere 8.0 The first thing we’re going to do is create a vSphere VM. I’m using VMware Workstation Pro, but you should be able to use any other hypervisor like VirtualBox or Hyper-V. Make sure you’re giving the VM ample RAM and CPU cores. ESXi requires at least 8 GBs of RAM and two CPU cores. My laptop I’m running this on has 16 GBs of RAM, so I’ll give the VM half of that.</description>

      <description>Pytasks is my solution to coming up with good ideas for projects and then promptly forgeting them 30 minutes later. It&amp;rsquo;s also useful for remembering chores and other items. It reads and writes from a file in your home directory. You can add items with the -a or &amp;ndash;add options, you can delete items with the -d and &amp;ndash;delete options, and you can list your todo list with -l and &amp;ndash;list.</description>

      <description>Pyshell is my first attempt at making a shell. Currently it has 13 built in commands. You can add your own commands by making a python script and adding it to the &amp;ldquo;funcs/&amp;rdquo; directory in your home directory. It&amp;rsquo;s written in python as the name eludes to. You can run outside commands using subprocesses with the sub command. You can also make scripts with the commands in the funcs directory but it is still unstable at this time.</description>
